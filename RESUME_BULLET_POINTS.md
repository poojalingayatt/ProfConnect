# ProfConnect - Resume Bullet Points

## Professional Experience Highlights

**Full-Stack Developer | Academic Appointment Booking Platform**
*ProfConnect - React + Node.js + PostgreSQL*

• **Designed and implemented** a real-time appointment booking system with conflict detection and role-based access control, serving as the core foundation for academic scheduling between students and faculty members.

• **Built a distributed notification architecture** using Socket.IO and React Query for seamless state synchronization across multiple clients, enabling instant real-time updates for appointment status changes and faculty availability.

• **Implemented a robust appointment state machine** with rescheduling workflow and strict transition enforcement, ensuring data integrity through database-level constraints and backend validation.

• **Developed a comprehensive review & rating system** with backend-aggregated reputation scoring, featuring write-once reviews per appointment and 5-star rating aggregation with proper conflict prevention.

• **Engineered authentication and authorization** with JWT-based session management, role-specific routing, and secure logout functionality including proper socket disconnection and cache clearing.

• **Created a faculty discovery system** with advanced search and filtering capabilities, real-time follow/unfollow functionality, and profile viewing with integrated review data presentation.

## Technical Achievements

• **Optimized frontend performance** through React Query caching strategies, code splitting, and efficient re-rendering patterns, reducing unnecessary API calls and improving user experience.

• **Implemented database-level conflict prevention** using unique constraints on faculty availability slots, preventing double-booking scenarios at the data layer.

• **Established clean architecture principles** with backend as single source of truth, proper separation of concerns, and maintainable code organization following industry best practices.

• **Built responsive UI components** using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, creating a mobile-first design system with consistent user experience across all device types.
